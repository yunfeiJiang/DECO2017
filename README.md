# DECO2017
This site has four pages, which are task, timer, music and dictionary.
in the task page, users are able to add new tasks and edit the tasks. In my original design, I decided to have a pop-up window for editing, but it finds very hard when i'm actually writing the code, so I changed the structure to make sure the functions are working correctly even though The appearance of the page may not be aesthetically pleasing.
also i find it hart to make the connection between the data users enter and the quadrant on the right side. I didn't manage to make the system automaticaaly classify the tasks. but users can select it on their own during editing.
in the timer page, there are stop watch and pomodoro time. The two clocks used to be arranged vertically, so the user needs to slide the mouse wheel to switch between the clocks.Based on the feedback from the last assignment, I have improved this page so that the user can select the clock they want in the bar above.
On the music page, the user can hover over the image to stop the scrolling so that the user can click on the music they want
On the translation page, I didn't find a suitable api interface for querying synonyms when translating between Japanese and English, but I implemented a translation from English to Japanese words.
